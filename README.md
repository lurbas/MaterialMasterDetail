Android Application sample of how to implement Master/Detail pattern that follows Material Design visual language.

It is a part of an article called "Case Study. Master/Detail Pattern" published on my personal blog. I highly recommend reading it to gain more context and purpose of this app. 

Just follow [this link](https://medium.com/@lucasurbas/case-study-master-detail-pattern-revisited-86c0ed7fc3e).

You can also try it by downloading a demo from [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lucasurbas.masterdetail).
